# Public API Request
## **Grade:** :heavy_check_mark: Exceeds Expectations
### **Premise** 
> Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself.

> For this project, you'll build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

> You’ll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

> You’ll request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
### **Project Instructions**
1. Create your js/scripts.js file and wire it up to the HTML 
2. HTML
   - You'll be provided with a basic index.html file to use in your project. But this file is missing the main components of the app, which you will need to create and add to the DOM dynamically.
   - Comments in the index.html file contain examples of the markup you'll need to add. So use the markup in those comments as a template. And keep in mind that altering the arrangement of the markup and the attributes used may break the styles or functionality.
3. Structure, style and CSS
   - Your finished project should match the general position and layout of the mockups. If you you followed the arrangement and attributes of the template markup in the HTML comments, then the provided styles should accomplish this for you.
   - You are encouraged to experiment with things like color, background color, font, shadows, transitions and animations to make this project your own.
4. Get and display 12 random users
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Awesome ! 12 random users are pulled from the API.
5. Create a modal window
6. Add good code comments
7. Check for cross-browser consistency
### Extra Credit
1. Search
   - Add a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, you’ll need to adjust your API request to retrieve a user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet.
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > You have nailed this section here ! Information of 12 employees is displayed and employees can be filtered by the dynamically added search box.
2. Modal toggle
   - Add a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open.
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > You have nailed this section too ! Modal window displays the correct employee information and functionality has been added to switch back and forth between the employees.
3. Structure, style and CSS
   - Add or change at least one of the following:
     - color
     - background color
     - font
     - box or text shadows
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Awesome ! You have made this project your own by changing the CSS and the project perfectly matches the mockups.
### Overall Comments
> You have done an awesome job in this project ! I see you have used vanilla JavaScript with best practices. You have included code comments and the script is clean and well-organized. Excellent work here !

> You will be building your own portfolio on your next project with another JavaScript environment NodeJS. It will be a fun project with a lot of learning opportunities. Go for the exceeds again next time and best of luck :) .
